      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>requirement inception (eliciting requirements)</emphasis>, to collect

    <title>An iterative process</title>
    <para>The proposed workflow is iterative so that reference solutions can be reworked in the light of increased knowledge and to take under control the problems listed in <xref linkend="h.5an7rpesemtx.1" />. Iteration means that the scientific stakeholders should provide use cases and refine them based on feedbacks received by other stakeholders and by the OPFPS members. With an iterative process that will involve all stakeholders, mistaken assumptions can be detected and corrected.</para>
    <para>
    The OPFPS members are available to update the common workflow for each new use case that is added or updated.
