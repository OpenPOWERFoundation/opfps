    <para>Physical Science is any science concerned with nonliving matter,

    <title>OPFPS workflow</title>
    <para>A basic OPFPS workflow could be summarized as the following:</para>
    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
      <listitem>
        <para>requirement inception (eliciting requirements), to collect
        functional requirements (e.g. as use cases) and related
        non-functional requirements from scientific community (from
        scientific stakeholders);</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>requirement analysis, determining and refining the system
        requirements, to provide a coherent view of the use cases, and to
        resolve misunderstanding (from OPFPS members);</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>system modelling: deriving a logical workflow/dataflow model of
        the system, to derive commonalities between different use cases (from
        OPFPS members);</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>enable ICT stakeholders to provide suitable solution.</para>

    <para>This Note covers the requirement inception phase.</para>
    </section>
   <section xml:id="h.1tyskhwshjst.2">
    <title>An iterative process</title>
    <para>The proposed process is iterative, so that reference solutions can be reworked in the light of increased knowledge and to take under control the problems listed in <xref linkend="h.5an7rpesemtx.1" />. Iteration means that the scientific stakeholders should provide use cases and non-functional requirements and refine them based on feedbacks received by other stakeholders and by the OPFPS members. With an iterative process that will involve all stakeholders, those mistaken assumptions can be detected and corrected.</para>
    <para>
    The OPFPS members are available to update the common workflow for each new use case that is added or updated.
    </para>
    <para>Iterations will be made also on the proposed methodology: </para>
